### 👋 Hi there, I'm Wahyu Mahendra

I'm a Junior Data Analyst with a growing passion for turning numbers into meaningful insights. My goal is to become a **professional Business Analyst**, but I'm always open to exploring different areas of data — wherever curiosity and opportunity take me.

---

### 🔧 Tools & Skills
- **Power BI** | **Excel** | **SQL** | **Python**
- Experienced in building dashboards, cleaning and exploring datasets, and delivering insights through clear visuals and code.

### 📈 What I'm Working On
Right now, I'm focused on:
- Growing my **portfolio** through hands-on personal projects
- Deepening my understanding of **business workflows** and real-world data applications
- Learning to **communicate insights effectively** and collaborate with stakeholders

---

### 🎯 Why Data?
I got into data because I genuinely enjoy the process — I’d dive in and lose track of time. Along the way, I’ve learned that being a data analyst isn’t just about tools or technical skills, but also about **business thinking, collaboration**, and **storytelling with data**.
