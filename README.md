### 👋 Hi there, I'm Wahyu Mahendra

I'm a Junior Data Analyst with a growing passion for turning numbers into meaningful insights. My goal is to become a **professional Business Analyst**, but I stay open to exploring different areas of data, wherever curiosity and opportunity take me.

---

### 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Power BI** | **Excel** | **SQL** | **Python**
- Comfortable building dashboards, , cleaned data, exploring datasets, and finding insights through clean visuals and code.

---

### 📈 What I'm Working On
Currently focused on:
- Building my **portfolio** with hands-on personal projects
- Deepening my understanding of **business workflows** and real-world applications of analytics
- Learning how to **communicate data insights clearly** and align with stakeholder needs

### 🎯 Why Data?
I started this journey because I found myself getting lost in data. Time flew, and I loved the process. Over time, I realized being a Data Analyst isn’t just about tools or numbers, but about **collaboration, business understanding**, and making data actually *matter*.
